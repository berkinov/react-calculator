# Welcome to My Reactjs Calculator
***

## Task
I tried to solve all the problems that arose from the stackoverflow forum.
And the big problem was with dokode.

## Description
I tried to rewrite the code again until the project worked.

## Installation
All the necessary packages are already installed, you will need to run the project by going to the calculator folder and in the terminal write the command "npm start".

## Usage
First install npm version 8.19.2 and use the "npm i" command to initialize the project before checking it out please.
I do not know why, but without these commands it does not work.

All the necessary packages are already installed, you will need to run the project by going to the calculator folder and in the terminal write the command "npm start".
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
